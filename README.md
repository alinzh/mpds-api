==========

![MPDS: Materials Platform for Data Science](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpds-io/datascience/gh-pages/mpds.png "MPDS: Materials Platform for Data Science")

This repository currently contains:

- an issue tracker for the MPDS API
- the website [developer.mpds.io](http://developer.mpds.io) with the MPDS API documentation
- the kickoff Python scripts (API demos):
    - The uranium-oxygen chemical bond length distribution
    - Clustering the band gaps of binary compounds
    - The relationship between a physical property and crystalline structure
- MPDS API Jupyter notebooks: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mpds-io/mpds-api/gh-pages?filepath=notebooks)
    - Short MPDS intro: basic plotting using the periodic table
    - Basic MPDS API usage: machine-learning and peer-reviewed data
    - More advanced MPDS API usage: unusual materials phases from the machine learning
    - More advanced MPDS API usage: pVT-data and EoS fitting
